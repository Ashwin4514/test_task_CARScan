# test_task_CARScan
The following repository contains all the tools that have been used to complete the test_task given by CARScan.Ai for its internship opportunity.

For this task, I have used two models namely:

Mask RCNN trained on MS-COCO Dataset: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git
DEEPlabV3+ Model trained for Chainging background:  https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib/releases/download/1.1/deeplabv3_xception_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
